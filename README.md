Implemented a simple fractal drawing project which constructs a fractal using the following methodology:

  -Select the vertices of a regular pentagon or hexagon ( right click anywhere inside the window for the options to appear ).
  
  -Select a random point q inside the chosen shape.
  
  -Select one of the vertices at random and find point p which is located 1/3 of the distance going from point q to selected vertex.
  
  -Draw point p and consider it as the next q ( to be used for the next iteration ).
  
  -Repeat the last 2 steps for a number of iterations ( options for 8000 and 15000 iterations ).
  

Notes: 

  -The shape can be moved around the window by holding down the left mouse button and dragging it to a new position.
  
  -Every time one of the options for number of iteration is chosen the shape is redrawn.
  
  -Option for 15000 iterations randomizes the color of each point.
  
  -Option for 8000 iterations picks a random color and assigns it to every point.
